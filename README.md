# CCP-Compare-Mode-with-PIC16F877A
This project uses the PIC16F877A's CCP1 module in Compare Mode to trigger periodic interrupts based on Timer1. After every 31 compare match events, an LED connected to RC4 toggles. It's useful for learning timed events, periodic interrupts, and CCP compare functionality.
